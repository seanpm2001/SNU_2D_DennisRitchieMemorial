Translations in languages other than English are machine translated and are not yet accurate. No errors have been fixed yet as of March 21st 2021. Please report translation errors [here](https://github.com/seanpm2001/SNU-DennisRitchieMemorial/issues/). Make sure to backup your correction with sources and guide me, as I don't know languages other than English well (I plan on getting a translator eventually) please cite [wiktionary](https://en.wiktionary.org) and other sources in your report. Failing to do so will result in a rejection of the correction being published.

Note: due to limitations with GitHub's interpretation of markdown (and pretty much every other web-based interpretation of markdown) clicking these links will redirect you to a separate file on a separate page that isn't the intended page. You will be redirected to the [.github folder](/.github/) of this project, where the README translations are hosted.

Translations are currently done with Bing translate and DeepL. Support for Google Translate translations is coming to a close due to privacy concerns.

# SNU-DennisRitchieMemorial
A memorial center for Dennis Ritchie, the grandfather of  UNIX, B, BCPL, ALTRAN, and Multics. One of the most underrated people in the history of computing.

***

## About

See above. This project is a memorial to Dennis Ritchie, who was a computer science pioneer born on September 9th 1941 and went on to create various contributions to computer science still used today, with the help of Ken Thompson, such as the C programming language, the UNIX operating system, and more. Although not a household name, it is said that if you had a magnifying glass for looking inside a computer, you could see his works everywhere, most notably for the standards he made, the C programming language, the UNIX operating system, and the UNIX philosophy.

Circa 2021 October 12th, Dennis Ritchie was found dead in his apartment. His death was not ruled a suicide, but was attributed to worsening prostate cancer and heart disease. Unfortunately, his death was largely overshadowed by the death of Apple founder Steve Jobs (if Dennis Ritchie didn't create what he did, Apple would be a very different company today, or not one at all, so it is sad to see his death get overshadowed like this)

***

## 2021 update

This project received a big update to its tributes on 2021 September 9th, on this day, Dennis Ritchie would have been 80 years old. Unfortunately, he died on 2011 October 12th

On this day, the project was modernized and received its own website. The official language of the project was also changed to C, Dennis's most notable contribution to computer science behind UNIX. HTML is now ignored.

***

## Notable works

### The C programming language

![The_C_Programming_Language_logo](/The_C_Programming_Language_logo.svg)

The C programming language is one of Dennis Ritchies most notable works, and is available on nearly every current computer in the world. It was created in the year 1970 and superceded the B programming language. It has still been going strong, and as of 2021, it has been in the top 3 for most used and most liked programming languages since 2001 or earlier. [Source needed](https://www.example.com/)

Here is an early example of functions in K&R C (Ken and Ritchie C)

```c
long some_function();
/* int */ other_function();

/* int */ calling_function()
{
    long test1;
    register /* int */ test2;

    test1 = some_function();
    if (test1 > 0)
          test2 = 0;
    else
          test2 = other_function();
    return test2;
}
```

Here is the famous C Hello World program:

```c
main()
{
    printf("hello, world\n");
}
```

And here is a conforming version of the above sample:

```c
# include <stdio.h>

int main(void)
{
    printf("hello, world\n");
}
```

#### The B programming language

BCPL, or the B programming language was the precursor to the C programming language. Although not widely used, it was the foundation of what the C programming language was built on.

Source code sample:

```c
/* The following function will print a non-negative number, n, to
   the base b, where 2<=b<=10.  This routine uses the fact that
   in the ASCII character set, the digits 0 to 9 have sequential
   code values.  */

printn(n, b) {
        extrn putchar;
        auto a;
        /* Wikipedia note: auto declares a variable with automatic
           storage (lifetime is function scope), not "automatic typing"
           as in C++11. */

        if (a = n / b)        /* assignment, not test for equality */
                printn(a, b); /* recursive */
        putchar(n % b + '0');
}
```

Another sample:

```c
/* The following program will calculate the constant e-2 to about
   4000 decimal digits, and print it 50 characters to the line in
   groups of 5 characters.  The method is simple output conversion
   of the expansion
     1/2! + 1/3! + ... = .111....
   where the bases of the digits are 2, 3, 4, . . . */

main() {
	extrn putchar, n, v;
	auto i, c, col, a;

	i = col = 0;
	while(i<n)
		v[i++] = 1;
	while(col<2*n) {
		a = n+1 ;
		c = i = 0;
		while (i<n) {
			c =+ v[i] *10;
			v[i++]  = c%a;
			c =/ a--;
		}

		putchar(c+'0');
		if(!(++col%5))
			putchar(col%50?' ': '*n');
	}
	putchar('*n*n');
}
v[2000];
n 2000;
```

These samples are from Dennis Ritchie and Ken Thompsons book on the C programming language.

#### ALTRAN

ALTRAN (ALgebraic TRANslator) is a programming language based on FORTRAN that allows for Algebraic translations. It is not very well known, but it is something he made.

Source code sample:

```fortran
     PROCEDURE MAIN # SIMPLE EXAMPLE OF USE OF FTNOUT
     LONG ALGEBRAIC (X:10,Y:10) F
     ALTRAN FTNOUT
     OPTS(201,72) # FTNOUT REQUIRES A LINE LENGTH OF 72
     F = EXPAND( (X+2*Y+1000000)**3 )
     WRITE F # PRINT F
     WRITE (25) " FUNCTION F(X,Y)"
                "C EXAMPLE PROG WRITTEN WITH FTNOUT." ,
                F ,
                " RETURN"™,       " END"
# WE HAVE WRITTEN A SIMPLE PROGRAM ON UNIT 25, NOW WE INVOKE FTNOUT TO
# THIS ALTRAN OUTPUT TO LEGAL FORTRAN.
     FTNOUT
     END
```

### UNIX

_UNIX does not have its own logo

Dennis Ritchie was one of the 2 original creators of the UNIX operating system and its design philosophy.

UNIX is still widely used today, but not the original system. The UNIX philosophy is still shared in many major modern projects, such as Linux (and its 600+ distributions) BSD (FreeBSD, NetBSD, DragonflyBSD, OpenBSD, MacOS, etc.) Solaris, and more.

![UNIX_Structure.png](/UNIX_Structure.png)

#### Multics

![Multics_logo.gif](/Multics_logo.gif)

MULTICS `Multiplexed Information and Computing Service` was the precursor to the UNIX operating system. It has been said that Multics "has influenced all modern operating systems since, from microcomputers to mainframes." [better source needed, WARNING: Google link](https://www.google.com/books/edition/The_Tym_Before/kn9eDwAAQBAJ?hl=en&gbpv=1&bsq=page 66)

### The C programming language book

The book on the C programming language was created by Dennis Ritchie and Ken Thompson. It was the first detailed guide to the C programming language.

***

## History

This project has a short history so far.

### Pre-history

This project was developed under SNU 3. Its development started on 2020 January 16th, but wasn't made public until 2020 June 3rd, when it was uploaded to GitHub during a transition phase (the start of the Git era, and the first month where I started converting my private projects like SNU into public projects)

### Alpha history

On 2020 June 4th, this project received a Wiki, and its own `README.md` file.

On 2021 June 17th, after over a year of no development, this project was brought slightly up to code, and its next big update was planned for 2021 September 9th, the 80th birthday of Dennis Ritchie. This project also received its own organization today.

On 2021 September 9th, this project received a massive documentation and content update and was brought up to date to celebrate 80 years of Dennis Ritchies life and afterlife. This project also received its own website today.

### Beta history

No Beta history to show for this project.

### Modern history

## Software status

All of my works are free some restrictions. DRM (**D**igital **R**estrictions **M**anagement) is not present in any of my works.

![DRM-free_label.en.svg](/DRM-free_label.en.svg)

This sticker is supported by the Free Software Foundation. I never intend to include DRM in my works.

I am ussing the abbreviation "Digital Restrictions Management" instead of the more known "Digital Rights Management" as the common way of addressing it is false, there are no rights with DRM. The spelling "Digital Restrictions Management" is more accurate, and is supported by [Richard M. Stallman (RMS)](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Richard_Stallman/) and the [Free Software Foundation (FSF)](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Free_Software_Foundation/)

This section is used to raise awareness for the problems with DRM, and also to protest it. DRM is defective by design and is a major threat to all computer users and software freedom.
